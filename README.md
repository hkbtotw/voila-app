<p> Jupyter Notebook - Presentation/ Dashboard by Python Voila </p><br />

<b>Preamble:</b><br />

<p>In data processing and application process, presenting the processed data to the team requesting for feedback normally occurs frequently.</p>
<p>It is found wasteful to crop or save images from notebook and put in presentation. The better solution is to use Voila to create presentation which retains interactivity of notebook plot and could be put on web for showcasing.</p>
